# IFT2015-TP2
Second assignment of the class IFT2015.

An extremely primitive form of a pharmacy inventory database. Management is done using a text file with a specific format as input, and it outputs a text file in a specific format as well.

All examples of input text files are in the "tests" folder, where x.txt indicates the input file and x+.txt indicates what the output should look like, with slight deviations.

The code implements a binary search tree, as per requirement of the assignment. The "stock" element of the database is stored as a BST, where different operations are performed depending on what is asked to do.
